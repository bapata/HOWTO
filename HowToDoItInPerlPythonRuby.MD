Introduction
  As a devops engineer, I have to maintain code written in several programming (dynamic scriptinging) languages. 
I always wanted to write something like – how do I do this in perl/python/ruby (and may be bash) kind of blog and 
here it is.

Here are some of the initial topics. I won’t claim the code shown here is the most efficient way to do but just one
of the ways to do stuff.

#!/usr/bin/{perl, python,ruby} (as appropriate) assumed for each line of code below.

ARGC/ARGV

How do I get input from command-line when I invoke my script as

script.{pl,py,rb}   myfile.txt

Perl

my ($arg1) = @ARGV;
print "Script name: " . __FILE__;
print "\nArgument-1: " . $arg1;
print "\n";
Python

import sys
my_script_name,arg1 = sys.argv
print "Script name: " + my_script_name
print "Argument-1: " + arg1
Ruby

arg1, = ARGV
puts "Script name: " + __FILE__
puts "Argument-1: " + arg1
